    "\n",
    "To properly formulate the <abbr title=\"Linear Optimization\">LO</abbr> model, we will start from the premise that the squares on the board will be the Cartesian product of the ranges $I$ of rows and $J$ of columns present on the board. In addition, it is necessary to have defined an interval $K$ for the set of numbered squares.\n",

    "\n",
    "This time, the definition of sets will be more than fundamental to reducing the complexity of the model, as we will avoid having to deal with numerous exceptions. From the ranges determined previously, we can define the set of vertices ($V$) and edges ($E$) existing in the network logic. In addition to these, it is also necessary to consider the subsets of numbered vertices ($N$) and blocked edges ($W$), since, in some instances of Zip game, there may be walls between two squares that prevent the path from being traced between them.\n",
    "\n",

To simplify, whenever possible, we can replace the notation $x_{ijrs}$ with $x_{vw}$ and $u_{ij}$ with just $u_v$, since the sequence $(i, j) = v$ always refers to some vertex belonging to $V$ set.\n",

    "u_v \\ge 0, \\forall v \\in V\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocked edges constraints** — If there is a wall between a pair of squares, then the sum of the edges connecting those ones must be equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{v,w} + x_{w,v} = 0, \\forall (v,w) \\in W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuity constraints** — Since it is only possible to enter and exit a node once (except for the initial and destination nodes), then we will have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of the edges emanating from a node must equal 1 (except for the destination square).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{w \\in V}{x_{v,w}} = 1, (v,w) \\in E, \\forall v \\in V \\backslash \\{v_p\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of the edges arriving at a node must equal 1 (except for the initial square).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{v \\in V}{x_{v,w}} = 1, (v,w) \\in E, \\forall w \\in V \\backslash \\{w_1\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of the edges emanating from the destination node must be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{w \\in V}{x_{v_p,w}} = 0, (v_p,w) \\in E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sum of the edges arriving at the initial node must be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{v \\in V}{x_{v,w_1}} = 0, (v,w_1) \\in E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It only makes sense to apply the last two constraints if the edges entering the initial square and exiting the destination square have already been removed from the graph, but I included them because I started from a model where the initial and destination nodes can be changed from game to game without needing to alter the basic structure of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it were a complete digraph, where all vertices were connected to each other, the number of constraints needed to guarantee the elimination of any cycle would be on the exponential order of $2^{|V|+1}$. That is, for our graph of 36 squares, this would represent, in the worst case, formulating a PPLB model with no less than $2^{37} = 137,438,953,472$ constraints!\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since a square can only be visited once, it also makes sense to include a set of constraints to prevent the selection of a pair of edges that enter and exit the same square, forming a cycle (sub-route) in the graph. However, in addition to the constraints for eliminating cycles composed of 2 decimal places, it would also be necessary to include constraints to prevent cycles of 3, 4… up to 34 decimal places in our case, which would require a monstrous number of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the number of constraints for eliminating cycles is immensely reduced if the **Miller-Tucker-Zemlin** (MZT) formulation is used, shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subroute Elimination Constraints** — The advantage of the <abbr title=\"Miller-Tucker-Zemlin\">MZT</abbr> formulation is that the number of constraints to be included to guarantee subroute elimination is equal to $|E| = 4nm — 2n — 2m$, that is, the number of edges in the graph. Thus, the number of constraints grows linearly as a function of the number of edges, instead of exponentially as a function of the number of vertices. For it to work, it requires the addition of more decision variables (the previously mentioned $u_{ij}$), which represent the absolute ordinal position of square $(i, j)$ within the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the position of the starting square must be equal to 1, since it will always be the first position on the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{v_1} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, the positions of the remaining squares on the board should be given as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_w \\ge u_v + 1 - M(1 - x_{v,w}), w \\in V \\backslash \\{w_1\\}, \\forall (v,w) \\in E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation, $M$ corresponds to a constant whose value is large enough to cover all possible positions a square can assume on the path. Therefore, a sufficiently large value of $M$ corresponds to $M = |V|$, that is, $M$ must be at least equal to the number of squares on the board (which in our particular case is 36).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the <abbr title=\"Miller-Tucker-Zemlin\">MZT</abbr> formulation, we will see that, if $x_{ij} = 1$, the restriction reduces to $u_w ≥ u_v + 1$. Thus, the position of the subsequent square will be at least equal to the subsequent position of the previous square, which guarantees that square $w$ \"is ahead\" of square $v$. However, if $x_{vw} = 0$, then the constraint will be $u_w \\ge u_v + 1 – 36 \\implies u_w - u_v \\ge –35$, which will always be true since it relaxes the constraint enough to be satisfied for any feasible value for $u_v$ and $u_w$. Therefore, the term $M(1 – x_{vw})$ ends up serving as a “switch” that turns the constraint on and off depending on whether the edge $(v,w)$ is part of the path or not; and that's what makes this formulation ingenious!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although not necessary, one can restrict the position of the destination square to be equal to the number of squares on the board, just to make the $u_v$ range from 1 to 36.\n",

    "**Order of precedence constraint** — In order for the path to traverse the numbered squares in ascending numerical order, it is necessary to impose the constraint that the position of a numbered square $i$ must be at least equal to the position subsequent to the last numbered square.\n",
