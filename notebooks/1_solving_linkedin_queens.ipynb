    "# Solving LinkedIn Queens with Linear Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Queens is a daily game available on LinkedIn as part of the platform's strategy to increase user engagement. Personally, I found it a really cool game for testing logical reasoning and problem-solving (it even made me rack my brain over some of the problems). Based on the game's rules, I realized it could be easily solved using Linear Programming, which turned out to be a great opportunity to apply what I learned in Operations Research courses during my university years. For this, I used Pyomo, a Python library geared towards mathematical modeling."

    "# Linear Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Optimization** (LO) is an area of Applied Mathematics that deals with deterministic optimization problems. For a model to represent a **Linear Optimization Problem** (LOP), its objective function and constraints must be linear formulas, that is, written as a sum of products between constants and variables, as in the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if the objective function is not linear or the problem presents at least one non-linear constraint, then it would already be a **Non-Linear Linear Optimization Problem** (NLOP) and we would need **Non-Linear Programming** (NLO) techniques to solve it (which fortunately is not the case for Queens 🙂).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the objective function and the model constraints are linear expressions, an <abbr title=\"Linear Optimization Problem\">LOP</abbr> implicitly assumes at least four hypotheses in its modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proportionality**: The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and to the model constraints must be directly proportional to its value. Situations that take into account economies of scale, initial manufacturing setup costs, etc., are examples where this principle is violated.\n",
    "- **Additivity**: The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and to the model constraints is independent of the values of the other decision variables. For example, the objective function $z(x,y)=2x+3y$ shows that the contribution $2x$ that the variable $x$ provides to $z$ is independent of the contribution $3y$ that the variable $y$ provides to $z$, satisfying the additivity assumption. However, $z(x,y)=2x+3y-xy$, for example, violates it, since the contribution of $x$ to $z$ is no longer $2x$, but rather $2x-xy$, which depends on the value of $y$.\n",
    "- **Divisibility and non-negativity**: Each of the decision variables can take any values within the set of positive real numbers, as long as they satisfy the model's constraints. In the case of Queens, as will be seen later, the variables will be of the binary type, which makes our <abbr title=\"Linear Optimization Problem\">LOP</abbr> a **Binary Linear Optimization Problem** (BLOP).\n",
    "- **Certainty**: The coefficients and independent terms of the objective function and the model's constraints are deterministic, that is, if it is modeled that $z(x,y)=2x+3y$, it would be assumed that the coefficients $2$ and $3$ of $x$ and $y$, respectively, would be known and certain, that is, it would be certain that the contribution of $x$ to $z$ would always be 2 times the amount of $x$, while the contribution of $y$ to $z$ would always be 3 times the amount of $y$, no matter what the values of $x$ and $y$ are. In the <abbr title=\"Binary Linear Optimization Problem\">BLOP</abbr> model for the Queens game, all coefficients and independent terms will be equal to 1 (except for the arbitrary constant $C$, which can take any value, as will be seen later)."

Because of this, we can define the objective function as maximizing (or minimizing, it doesn't matter) an arbitrary constant.

    "\n",
    "[**Pyomo**](https://www.pyomo.org/) is an open-source library for modeling optimization problems. Its main advantage is the ability to model problems using set logic, which allows defining a set of variables, parameters, and constraints from the definition of other sets of objects. For example, once one defines the set of ranges $I$, $J$, and $K$, it's possible to define, e.g., the set of houses, regions and diagonals with just one line of code each instead of defining them one by one, saving considerable time!\n",

    "The [**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org/) library, in turn, is geared towards manipulating and studying network structures. With it, it's possible to create graphs and solve problems modeled in network logic quickly and easily, such as the Shortest Path problem, Minimum Spanning Tree, Transportation and Transshipment problem, and other graph problems. Furthermore, it's possible to quickly draw graphs when combined with Matplotlib.\n",

The solver used was [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/lp/or/gurobi-optimizer/), a commercial optimization software capable of solving both Linear and Non-Linear Optimization Problems. To install it, simply run the following command in the terminal."
